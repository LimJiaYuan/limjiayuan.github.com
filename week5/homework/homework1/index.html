                    <h4>Explore the meaning of the ruins</h4>
                    <p>When we see the unearthed cultural relics in front of us, the traces of our ancestors show their grace without concealment, as if to tell the ancient legends to future generations. However, this is the real "story". Over time, the culture created by human behavior is more or less preserved. We long for more ancestral relics to appear, allowing us to understand each stage of human development and to study the inheritance in the development process.
                    <br>
                    However, it is a pity that many cultural relics cannot be fully preserved even after they are unearthed. Questions that we need to think about follow. The relics of ancestors buried deep in the ground will not be exposed to the air and sunlight because they are sealed, and they are preserved for future generations to have the opportunity to pay their respects. However, leaving the sealed environment, we must create the necessary conditions for these cultural relics, preserve them and try to maintain them in their original state, which is conducive to the continuous research of archaeologists and historians.
                    <br>
                    We have to marvel at how humans are constantly changing the material world. The development of history is a very long journey, and the great historical significance is deeply hidden in these antiques. Humans are not perfect. In the ancient world, human civilization could be established only after savage wars, and wars were also the main culprit in destroying history. The traces of history were destroyed in an instant, while the traces of war were preserved.
                    <br>
                    History was overwritten, destroyed by the fireworks of war. War can make civilization monuments disappear in an instant. In addition to war, material materials are also the basic conditions for the preservation of cultural relics, but it is a gradual process. For example, almost all animal and plant foods are difficult to preserve. In addition, most organic matter decays easily, such as wool, linen, wood, leather, grass, hair, or other similar materials, which will turn to ashes within a few years and can survive hundreds of years later. What came down is indeed a miracle created under very special conditions.
                    <br>
                    When we walked into the museum, what we saw were almost all stone, bone, metal, glass, pottery and other items that were not easily corroded, but most of them were damaged or even broken into pieces. However, as long as science and technology allow, no matter how serious the missing decayed parts are, we can study and identify them. There are some histories that we can only study through the written records left over from that time.
                    <br>
                    There are texts inscribed on walls, inscriptions on steles, and texts and patterns inscribed on objects, all of which have become the wealth of archaeologists. A huge museum is a display of history. Early prints, textiles, and some daily necessities silently state all aspects of historical life. The early utensils were all made of wood, and the technical level really makes modern people feel ashamed.</p>
